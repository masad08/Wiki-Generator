In the mid-20th century, this began to shift toward patient autonomy, spurred by the rise of informed consent and patients’ rights to accept or refuse treatments(Igel and <a href=\"#page-2\" data-internal-link=\"true\" data-page-id=\"page-2\" title=\"Navigate to: Page 2\" target=\"_blank\">Lerner, 2016). By the</a> 1980s, shared decision-making (SDM) had gained traction as the preferred model for clinical encounters(Elwyn et al., 2012). SDM is characterized by a collaborative process: clinicians share medical information and options, and patients contribute their values and preferences, with both parties jointly arriving at decisions that align with the patient’s goals.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div class=\"wiki-image-container\" style=\"\">\n        <img src=\"http://localhost:3001/api/wiki/testwiki5/images/1742605930768-Trigger tools initiative.png\" alt=\"Wiki Image\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px;\" class=\"wiki-image\">\n      </div><br></div><div><br></div><div>This evolution – from physician-driven <a href=\"#page-2\" data-internal-link=\"true\" data-page-id=\"page-2\" title=\"Navigate to: Page 2\" target=\"_blank\">decisions </a>to a partnership model – marked a fundamental change in the p<a href=\"#page-2\" data-internal-link=\"true\" data-page-id=\"page-2\" title=\"Navigate to: Page 2\" target=\"_blank\">atient–physician relationship</a>, aiming to respect patient autonomy while leveraging physician expertise</div>",
